# The Caveman Webscraper

Ultra simple web scraper that fetches the main article on nytimes.com
and stores it in an SQLite database. Used in the www.penpapercoding.com
infrastructure class. Also includes a small Flask app that displays
the information as a web app.

Consists of two files: scraper.py (the web scraper) and web.py
(the web app).

For deployment instructions, please refer to this slightly more
comprehensive web scraper:
